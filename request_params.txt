# EXCEPTION PROPAGATION
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52087743/flask-restful-noauthorizationerror-missing-authorization-header

Solution #1
The first solution that did work for me, was to propagate the exceptions... meaning that exceptions are re-raised instead of being handled by the app's error handlers. However, according to this it's not a great solution because it overrides Flask's native error handler functions: app.handle_user_exception and app.handle_exception.

So you would set PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS in your app configuration:

app.config['PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS'] = True

Solution #2

The final solution that I'm going with is to enhance the error handler of Flask's Api, based on a recent suggestion found here.

from flask import Flask
from flask_restful import Api

class CustomApi(Api):
    def handle_error(self, e):
        for val in current_app.error_handler_spec.values():
            for handler in val.values():
                registered_error_handlers = list(filter(lambda x: isinstance(e, x), handler.keys()))
                if len(registered_error_handlers) > 0:
                    raise e
        return super().handle_error(e)

app = Flask(__name__)
api = CustomApi(app, prefix='/api/v2') # same params can be passed here

#
